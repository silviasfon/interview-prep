# Interview Preparation

I'm a Software Engineer who is often studying not to lose her abilities. This repository aims to keep track of the material I use, the questions I've done so far and what I have learned.
I mostly do LeetCode and other coding questions but might add some system design stuff in the future.

### LeetCode

LeetCode questions only contain the functions required to solve the problem in the platform. The files can not be directly executed as there is no main and/or input/output functions.
